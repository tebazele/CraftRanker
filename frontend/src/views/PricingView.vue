        <div class="mx-5 my-3">
          <p>In our first month on Etsy, we made exactly one sale ðŸ˜¬</p>
          <p>We've learned a lot since then (like, a LOT). Over the past 9 years, our hobby has become a full-time job,
            and our Etsy shop (Fourth Wave Apparel) now ranks in the top 1% of all Etsy shops and has more than 25,000
            sales.</p>
          <p><span class="fw-bold text-turquoise">The University of Etsy</span> (our video masterclass series for Etsy
            sellers!) includes foundational work called "Etsy Essentials" and advanced learning called "Etsy Expert." Both
            masterclasses series are our love letter to Etsy sellers. We believe that a rising tide lifts all ships, and
            we love teaching other sellers how to learn from our success (and our mistakes). </p>
