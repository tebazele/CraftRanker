        <h5>Hi, I'm Noelle</h5>
        <p>
          If you’re like me when I started my Etsy shop, you’re probably wondering if you have what it takes. If your
          product is good enough.

          Even if you’ve seen some success, you may still think of your Etsy shop as your “little hobby.” And I want
          you to knock that off right now. I’ve found that the people who run Etsy shops are some of the most
          creative, tenacious people I know. And I have no doubt that you are one of them. You can do this. You DO
          have what it takes.

          A Little About Me:
          First of all, I’m a mom. A boy mom to Luke and Max, and a cat mom to Michelle. My husband Nate is the best
          person I know. He’s hilarious and sweet and has an adorably bald head.

          My degree is in Spanish translation, which I don’t use but don’t regret because it opens up an entire world
          of television to me. In addition to being a mom and Etsypreneur, I’ve worked “traditional” jobs in
          marketing, social media, writing, and editing. I don’t regret them either, even though I’ve never looked
          back from my decision to pursue Etsy as my full-time job.

          That’s me. I’m an introvert, which means that if you ever see me on a coaching video or webinar, I am
          definitely sweating. But I learned a long time ago that regularly doing scary, worthwhile things is a smart
          way to live. So here I am.

        Handmade doesn’t mean cute (I mean, it can). Handmade just means that you know how to roll up your sleeves and
        turn something ordinary into something incredible.

        And that’s exactly what we’re here to help you do. No matter where you are in your Etsy journey, we’re here to
        help you reach your goals. I love Etsy as an e-commerce platform. I want to help you feel the love (& success)
        we've found on Etsy too.

        A Little About Me:
        Like Noelle, I’m also a mom—to Kaylee, Eileen, and Tober. (Yes, Tober. The short story is that I let Kaylee
        name her baby brother when she was five. I swear I would have stepped in if she’d added too many Xs or Zs, but
        luckily, she hadn’t learned those letters yet). And my husband Bryan is, like Noelle’s Nate, adorably bald and
        pretty dang awesome and supportive.

        My degree is in Editing and SEO, and I started out in technical editing after college. I’ve edited everything
        from computer manuals to journal articles on aerospace engineering (a.k.a., rocket science). Technical editing
        has its perks, but working with Noelle in the Etsy shop has been so much more fun. The work we do pulls from
        all the technical training I’ve had and has given me opportunities to learn a lot of new, exciting things as
        well.
